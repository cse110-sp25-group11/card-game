## High Fidelity designs of the different pages on the app

1. Home Page:
   This is the home page where the user will first be brought to when the web page opens. It will contain one card on the screen at a time along with condensed information about that event (title, the organizer, a shortened version of the description, etc). The user will be prompted to either like or dislike this event.

2. Single Event Page:
   If a user clicks on the card itself, it will take them to this page of the event. This is to provide the user with an official flier of the event along with a longer version of the descrption and the same information from the card on the home page.

3. Posting an Event Page:
   Prompts the user to add an event to be added to the website. Asks for information such as the title, description, and organizers. Most of the information presented here would be stored as strings. The "upload" button will display the file name **after** the user has uploaded the file.

4. Browse an Event Page:
   Allows the user to visually see various events at a time from different categories. The left and right arrows would scroll to the next 3 events in each category (if there are any left). Clicking on a specific event would take the user to the Single Event Page.

5. Liked Events Page: 
    Allows the user to see all the events they have liked before in the past. This should be a scrollable page that lets the user see more events as they scroll done. No particular order is specified, but order from most recent to least recent is preferred.

5. Color Guide:
   General color guide of the colors used in the figma for the website. This is mainly for whoever is planning to work on the CSS parts of the website. All values here are written in hex.

6. Button Guide:
   Guide showing all of the buttons present in the website. Serves no other purpose other than letting the CSS and javascript developers know what the purpose of each button is.
