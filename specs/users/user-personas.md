# User Personas

Since we wanted to design an app for student life on campus, we created two user personas to better understand the needs and goals of our primary users. Our app, **Campus Swipe**, helps students discover campus events in real time through a swiping feature, while also giving student organizations an easy way to promote their events.

These personas reflect the two main user groups we are designing for:

1. Students looking for things to do on campus.
2. Student organizations who want to quickly and effectively share their events with others.

By grounding our design in these user perspectives, we aimed to create a more relevant and engaging experience for both groups.

## Student Persona

This persona represents a typical student who wants to find events to attend between classes, in the evenings, or on weekends. They may not always plan ahead and often look for fun or meaningful activities that are happening soon or nearby. For this user, **Campus Swipe** makes event discovery quick and fun.

## Student Org Persona

This persona represents a student organization member responsible for event outreach and engagement. Their main goal is to increase event attendance without spending too much time on promotions. They often rely on flyers, social media, or word of mouth methods that can be very time consuming or inconsistent. **Campus Swipe** gives them a faster, more targeted way to reach students who are actively looking for things to do, helping orgs gain visibility and connect with the right audience more effectively.

# Conclusion

These personas guided our design decisions throughout the development process, helping us prioritize intuitive event discovery and easy forms that cater directly to our users' needs.
