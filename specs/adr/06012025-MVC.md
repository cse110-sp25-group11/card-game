# No MVC

## Context and Problem Statement

- We were thinking of changing our current architecture to have a more proper form such as with Model View Controller where we can easily swap out databases if we need to.

## Considered Options

- Refactor all code to not directly access localStorage but to use a function instead
- Leave code as is currently

## Decision Outcome

Due to time constraints, we decided it would not be worth it to change up a lot of our backend to use this type of architecture. Most of our code also directly uses localStorage so going in and changing all of it will take a long time and will also lead to several merge conflicts as everyone is working on the code at the same time.

#### Positives of choice

- Ensures working product
- Reduces number of merge conflicts
- Lowers complexity of code base

#### Negatives of choice

- Code more tightly coupled
- Cannot swap out database easily in the future
