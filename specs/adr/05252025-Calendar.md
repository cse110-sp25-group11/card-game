# No Calendar in Project

## Context and Problem Statement

- In our inital prototyping and wireframes, we were planning to include a calendar page where users are able to look at the events they have liked. This page would have been helpful for users to both view their upcoming events and also review the previous events that they have attended.

## Considered Options

- Manually make the Calendar ourself
- Create another ADR to request use of the Google Calendar API
- Get rid of it completely

## Decision Outcome

In the end, we decided to completely get rid of that calendar page. Given our time constraints, it was not feasible to implement it since none of us have experience with such APIs or creating calendars either. We decided to match in our likedEvents into the browse Page instead.

#### Positives of choice
- Lowered the amount of work
- Less worry about API calls crashing
- More secure
#### Negatives of choice
- Loses visually appealing feature
