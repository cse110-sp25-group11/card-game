## Rough wireframes of the different pages on the App

1. Home Page
   ![Screenshot of Homepage LoFi](/specs/assets/homepageLoFi.png)
   This page will be directed to the user as soon as they launch the app. This is where our main feature will be. The user will be presented cards with info of campus events. This includes the name of the event, the date and duration, location, and a very brief description about the event. Then the user has two options, swipe left (not interested) or swipe right (interested and added to saved)
2. Single Event Page

   This page is presented when the user clicks on a campus event card. It displays even more info for the user
3. Posting an Event Page
   ![Screenshot of PostEvent LoFi](/specs/assets/postEventPageLoFi.png)
   This page is mainly for club organizers who want to promote their own event to students on campus. Its a simple form where all the info added will be stored on the event card. This is then presented on the homepage
4. Browse an Event Page
   ![Screenshot of Browsing an Event Page](/specs/assets/browseEventPageLoFi.png)
   This page is more of a strench goal. If we have time, we should be able to create a tab where the user can go browse through all the event cards.
5. Calendar Page
   ![Screenshot of Calendar page](/specs/assets/calendarPageLoFi.png)
   This page is just an idea if we have time (most likely not). But once the user swipes right on a campus event, it will show up here and auto import the time of the event+ day on the calendar

**Note:** _These wireframes are rough sketches of our app. Will most likely change as we progress._
